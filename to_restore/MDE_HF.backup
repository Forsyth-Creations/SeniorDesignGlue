S	2024	SpO2	ECE 2804 Integrated Design Project: SpO2 Pulse Oximeter	The goal of this project is to create an accurate SpO2 pulse oximeter, which measures heart rate and oxygen saturation. The circuit for this project uses only simple components found in a lab kit such as resistors, capacitors, and op-amps. Using these components, filters and amplifiers are created to make the signal output from the sensor usable. The output signal is then sent to an Arduino which handles all the signal processing and calculations. The Arduino uses algorithms to exclude any outliers and calculates the heart rate by measuring the time between the peaks of the signal and calculates the oxygen saturation with a formula that is directly proportional to the ratio of red and infrared light absorbed by the finger.	Lucas Polanco, Rahul Muthuraman
S	2024	Home Audio	ECE 2804 Integrated Design Project: Home Audio System Design	The project tackles the issue of accommodating the different speakers in a home audio system, as not all can be sufficiently powered through a standard audio jack. To resolve this, the home audio system employs a class-D amplifier to enhance the audio output, enabling diverse speakers to be effectively driven. In support of the amplification, the system incorporates a 3-band equalizer, granting users the ability to fine-tune bass, midrange, and treble frequencies, customizing the audio experience to their preferences. Moreover, a spectrogram feature is integrated to provide a visual representation of the audio.	Nate Guevara, Alex Betz

This course gave me skills in frontend development, learning C\\#, and SQL database interaction. In addition, it gave me practical experience with learning what type of documents  are created in industry and designing a project with a team.	Midlothian	Virginia	Johann Ruiz
S	2024	\N	Gagnon	John	johngagnon@vt.edu	BSCPE	Chip-Scale Integration	\N	\N	My goal is to become a VLSI/design engineer in the semiconductor industry. I want to push the boundaries of high-performance computing.	This course made me appreciate the time and effort that goes into research projects.	South Chesterfield	Virginia	John Gagnon
S	2024	\N	Skidmore	Thomas	skidmore2024@vt.edu	BSCPE	Controls, Robotics & Autonomy	\N	\N	As I still am early in my career, my career aspirations are not specific. However, I want to constantly challenge myself, learn and become a valuable leader. As a result of this experience, my interest in applications of FPGA systems has grown into my current focus. I hope to continue my academic career with a master's degree from Virginia Tech or begin my fulltime career with an entry-level computer hardware position.	The biggest lesson from this course is you cannot start early enough. Project management is a constant challenge especially when this is not our full time job, being a full time student means we all have different schedules and coursework. However, this course has certainly been a learning experience and has opened my eyes to the potential of FPGAs.	Virginia Beach	Virginia	Tommy Skidmore
S	2024	\N	Larus	John	jbl10@vt.edu	BSEE	Energy & Power Electronics Systems	\N	\N	I hope to contribute to bringing nuclear energy to the forefront and improving the utilization of renewable energy sources. Additionally, I hope to spend time working in system protection and fault analysis in order to reduce downtime and improve grid reliability and resiliency.	I have gained much experience as a result of working outside my primary field of study. I have grown passionate about RF through this project and I have gained invaluable experience in handling customer relations and professionalism at multiple levels.	Richmond	Virginia	John Larus III
S	2024	\N	Anteneh	Ehite	ehiteanteneh@vt.edu	BSCPE	Machine Learning	\N	\N	I will be working in a rotational program post graduation at Caterpillar. After finishing the program I plan to return to school to get a masters degree. I aspire to get into more managerial roles after buidling my expertise through gradaute school and real world experience.	This project has given me great exposure to the relationship between hardware and software in a radio frequency context. I have also developed skills such as interpreting code of other engineers and working alongside other engineers to complete a long-term goal with specifications, budgets, a customer, etc.	Alexandria	Virginia	Ehite Anteneh
S	2024	\N	Trinh	Tommy	tommyt20@vt.edu	BSEE	Energy & Power Electronics Systems	\N	\N	I aspire in working with electrical circuits and utilities in either the public or private sector. Additionally, I would like to work in maintaining and improving large scale machinery in order to reduce downtimes, improve production quality, and reduce costs.	I have learned a lot about project management and RF from working on this project. Although RF is outside my scope of study, I believe a good engineer should be able to adapt and learn more about concepts outside of their skillsets. I have learned a lot about how important project management is especially involving money and why certain protolcols are in place such that well-informed decisions are made to reduce delays and risks.	Springfield	Virginia	Tommy Trinh

F	2024	19	Optic Sensor Design and Vision System for Lightweight UAV	Non-Resident Alien	t	2	2	Executing	\N	\N	Search and rescue missions are enhanced with the use of UAVs. Nearly all commercially available UAVs contain their own camera and ability to observe on the ground what the UAV is displaying video of.  This project intends to determine an optimal UAV image system for the purposes of search and rescue using an inexpensive commercially available UAV.  Important factors include resolution, weight, power draw, mounting, cost, and ease of upgrade as technology improves. Once the optimum system is designed the image system will be tested for the purposes of a search and rescue applications to include the development of image recognition search and rescue software.

S	2024	6	Drone Instrument to Advance Search for Life in Our Solar System	Non-Resident Alien	t	3	2	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	For this project, we seek the miniaturization and improvement of instrument electronics to operate a revolutionary multifunctional sensor platform technology developed by researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).  The multifunctional sensor platform can provide autonomous, in-situ detection of methane and other trace gases that are important in the search for life throughout the solar system. The current implementation of the instrument electronics is about the size of large camera, can be mounted on a tripod, and has low power requirements.  Part of the path to advancing this technology towards applications in space involves field demonstrations here on Earth, in Alaska.  For these field demonstrations, the GSFC team seeks concepts that would further miniaturize the instrument electronics to make them more compact and suitable for deployment as a drone payload (under 2 kg).  The researchers are planning a follow-up field campaign in the summer of 2024. For this they would like to augment the measurements from their stationary sensor platforms with mobile and autonomous drone-based sensor systems.  Eventually researchers would like to deploy these sensors to the Moon, Mars, and Ocean Worlds, across a variety of spacecraft, rovers, and drones to continue the search for life in our solar system.  
S	2024	7	Decision Tree Graphical Editor and Execution for Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities	US Citizen	t	0	5	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Decision trees are customer-specific; the expectation is that customers will start with a standard tree (such as CISA’s SSVC) and then adapt it to better fit their specific decision policy to better match their cybersecurity program. Essentially the decision tree encodes their cybersecurity playbook for how to handle a vulnerability for each machine within their OT system.\nThis project creates a graphical editor to create a new or modify an existing decision tree. The decision tree’s structure, consisting of inputs, decision points (aka nodes), and possible outcomes, are stored in a database. The editor supports the ability to interactively “run” the decision tree configuration against different test scenarios, as well as to autonomously execute all test cases as a regression test
S	2024	10	ECE Robotic Competition SW Team	Non-Resident Alien	t	0	5	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Design a robot to compete in IEEE SouthCon 2024 Hardware Competition to be held in Atlanta GA.  For more Information see the following:  Competition Rules at https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/497/SEC24-HW-Competition_V5.3_draft.pdf.
S	2025	25	SuperDARN HF Radar Lab	Non-Resident Alien	\N	4	0	\N	\N	\N	Design and prototype a system to remotely monitor parameters (voltages/status and temperature) on a SuperDARN transmitter.  The prototype system will be tested in a transmitter setup in a lab at Virginia Tech. The SuperDARN HF Radar Lab at Virginia Tech operates 5 radars at 4 sites between Virginia, Kansas, northern Ontario, and Labrador.  Each of these sites uses an electrically steerable array to scan across a field-of-view.  To receive enough signal off of plasma irregularities in the ionosphere, each site uses 16 transmitters.  Each transmitter is capable of putting RF power forward, but switches fast enough to pass low-power received signals onto to be phased corrected.  The transmitters currently have some simple controls to protect itself from doing unnecessary damage to some circuits.  However, the ability to remotely monitor the status of each of the transmitters any of the sites does not exist.  Knowing the condition of each of the transmitters remotely helps researchers prepare for costly maintenance trips that may happen only once or twice a year.
S	2024	9	ECE Robotic Competition HW Team	Non-Resident Alien	f	5	0	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Design a robot to compete in IEEE SouthCon 2024 Hardware Competition to be held in Atlanta GA.

F	2024	15	Million Device Security	Non-Resident Alien	t	0	4	Executing	\N	\N	Much is made of the Internet of Things but security is often an afterthought. Delve in to the strength and weakness of the ATM TrustZone CrytpoCell in a variety of network configurations to determine best programming practices and different vectors for attack based on network type.
F	2024	20	Inverse Design of RF Passive Components	Non-Resident Alien	t	2	2	Executing	\N	\N	The spectrum used for wireless communications remains cluttered and it is one of the prime challenges associated with migration to the 6th Generation of wireless communications. Filtering is commonly used in radio front-ends to suppress unwanted interference. A recent trend in photonics is to use optimized pixelated surfaces that can perform classical passive operations in optical circuits (e.g., polarization splitters, waveguides, lenses, etc.). Since these pixelated surfaces are exploiting the wave-like behavior of light, it is reasonable that pixelated surfaces can be made to realize passive functions at RF frequencies; hence, such pixelated surfaces could be used to realize random RF components (e.g., filters, matching networks, power splitters/combiners, etc.). There are no closed form solutions to describe the design of these surfaces. PI Walling's group has developed some tools that use Inverse design to realize pixelated filters, however, the methods we are currently using are iterative. We would like to enhance the tools used in designing passive structures, using either machine learning approaches, and/or faster iterative simulation methods. In this project, we will develop a set of tools for rapid synthesis of pixelated surfaces and then we will fabricate and test representative examples.
S	2025	26	CMOS Detector Small Satellite Readout System	Non-Resident Alien	\N	3	1	\N	\N	\N	Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) requires a low noise, size, weight, mass, and power control system for a CMOS detector for our suborbital and orbital pursuits.

S	2025	28	Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) System Development for Launch Pad Oversight at the Virginia Spaceport Authority (VSA)	Non-Resident Alien	\N	0	4	\N	\N	\N	As VSA continues to expand operations by bringing new launch pads and processing facilities online, it is crucial to develop a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that provides a unified architecture for all facilities. This SCADA system will serve as a common interface for independent control systems, offering full visibility, data logging, and manipulation capabilities across all sites. The project will involve the development of system architecture, networking, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for data visibility and control. Students will be responsible for developing a SCADA system to support one launch pad. The project will involve building a graphical user interface (UI), mapping the UI to specific inputs and outputs (I/O), developing SCADA architecture, and ensuring reliable communication between the SCADA system and the launch pad using Ethernet/IP. By the end of the project, the launch pad should be fully operational with SCADA support.
F	2024	21	Create A Network Portmap Billboard Hacking Challenge	Non-Resident Alien	t	1	3	Executing	\N	\N	The Virginia Cyber Range needs knowledgeable design engineers to deliver a hardware/software/wifi challenge in a box" for our annual 2025 Cyberfusion Cybersecurity CTF competition.

S	2024	4	Parallelized Photonic Computation Analysis of Alternatives	US Citizen	t	3	2	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Success on the next generation battlefield requires running advanced AI/ML techniques on networks of sensors on the edge.  In order to utilize those techniques on the small SWaP-C processors at the edge, BAE is pursuing advances in low-energy compute techniques such as photonic (light-based) computing.   This study models parallelized photonic compute techniques (PPCT) capability and compares performance to other options. 
S	2024	11	Build an Electronic Chemical Sniffer	Non-Resident Alien	t	3	2	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Lithium-Ion batteries are common in modern electronics but for safety reasons cannot be outside of a passenger cabin during commercial flights.

S	2024	22	Health monitoring new born foals and their mothers	Non-Resident Alien	t	2	3	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	 The Marion duPont Scott Medical Center typically receives about 100 foals (newly born horses) during the January-June season. Health monitoring of these foals and their mothers is critical and needs to be done around the clock while they are in intensive care. Historically, this is done manually by the medical staff. This obviously costs time and efforts. Our goal is to automate this process so that monitoring is done electronically and the information is continuously fed back to the medical team so that informed decisions can be made in timely manner. The monitoring system has to be comfortable and non-invasive to the animal, has high degree of accuracy and can withstand animal movement.    
S	2024	16	Room to Text	Non-Resident Alien	t	0	5	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Design a system that can be deployed on a robot or drone to determine the shape and contents of a room.

F	2023	8	Object Detection with Computer Vision and Machine Learning	US Citizen	t	2	4	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	The fields of computer vision and object detection are evolving rapidly, and AIP Branch is invested in identifying and applying state-of-the-art detection model concepts from sources such as academia. This proposal seeks to identify one or more promising new methods, apply them to real data, and quantitatively assess their performance against a test data set. Countermine / AIP currently has a new unclassified RGB dataset that consists of various vehicles and people cleaned and amassed from several public datasets. AIP would like to task ASPIRE participants with developing real-time object-detection models to examine novel model architectures to be leveraged for internal algorithm development. \nAIP will also be initiating an approval process for an additional dataset that was collected from long-wave infrared (LWIR) sensors on various vehicles and people. If this data is formally approved for release when the program begins, all participants will need to be U.S. citizens in order to support this work. The participants involved for this project should focus design and development in small object-detection modelling. The field of small object-detection is under researched and could give way to publishable material. \nAIP will work with participants and standup bi-utfmonthly meetings to discuss updates and deliverables. A baseline model for the RGB dataset will be delivered by the students 2 months from the program start date with an expected minimum mAP@0.5 of approximately 0.5. AIP will expect additional fine-tuned models at the program's conclusion.
F	2023	6	Next Gen DC/DC Converter for CubeSats	Non-Resident Alien	t	4	0	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	For this project, we seek development and evaluation of concepts and production of at least one working prototype for a next generation DC/DC converter that: 1) utilizes emerging technologies to exceed the power output capacity and efficiency ratings of currently available off-the-shelf (OTS) products; and 2) is suitable for use in a very small spacecraft instrument.
F	2023	5	Secure Python Compiler and Bytecode Interpreter	US Citizen	t	0	5	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	Parsons develops and deploys software that represents significant investments of intellectual property and capital by our customers.  Developing and applying anti-reverse engineering techniques such as this helps prevent other parties from discovering algorithms and techniques used in the deployed software.   This is of interest to Parsons as it helps us assure the customer that their investments are protected from unnecessary loss.\n\nWe request the students design, implement, test, and deliver an extension to the Python language compiler and bytecode interpreter that allows python to create, load and execute encrypted bytecode.\n•\tApplication sources will need to be compiled and encrypted prior to being deployed to the host where they will execute.   Application sources themselves may not be required to be encrypted but unencrypted source files must not be deployed to the host where the application is executing.\n•\tWhile a common encryption algorithm should be used, encrypted bytecode that’s deployed to different hosts should be unique, verifiable by comparing their SHA 256 hash digest values. \n•\tThe design should use established encryption standards, such as AES.\n•\tThe design must include efforts to prevent discovery of the encryption key/IV used to decrypt the files.\n•\tThe decrypted files should not be written to disk prior to being executed.   Protection of the plain-text bytecode while in memory is not required for this project, but would be a desirable option.
F	2023	7	L-Band Satellite Tracking and Characterization System	Non-Resident Alien	t	4	0	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	We seek a portable system consisting of a high-gain antenna on a portable mount with motorized two-axis (i.e., “az-el” or equatorial) positioning to keep the antenna pointed at the satellite for the duration of an observation. The system includes a sensitive receiver with high immunity to spectrally-disjoint signals not of interest, and continuous Nyquist-rate sampling and streaming to local non-volatile storage.
F	2023	3	2.4 GHz Energy Detection Device	US Citizen	t	2	3	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	Parsons provides Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) systems and services to its customers. This project interests us with the potential development of new tools platforms and technologies to enhance TSCM services. The project’s results would be used to develop solutions that could be directly applicable to the Parsons customers and missions. \n\nToday the 2.4Ghz RF band is very crowded with unlicensed RF devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and other protocols. This spectrum crowding makes it difficult to locate and assess if there are any transmitters within a defined area. We request the students research and develop a simple 2.4Ghz band RF energy detector and recorder.  The intent of this detector is to identify and help to locate unknown 2.4GHz sources within a defined area, such as a particular room within a building, and differentiate them from the ambient 2.4Ghz transmissions created by nearby Wi-Fi or other known devices.\n•\tIdeally, the detector will be a self-contained portable system that records RF energy in a standard format that can be visualized using industry standard tools.\n•\tUse audio or visual feedback to guide user to locate a device when surveying a room.\n•\tDevices to test with may include BLE emitters (Apple Air Tag), Zigbee IoT devices, bluetooth speaker, or cell phone with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled.\n•\tPossible designs could use a chip such as LT5581 (e.g., Mikroe RF Meter 3 Click)\n•\tPossible processor choices could include but are not limited to a Sparkfun Thing Plus RP2040 or RP2040 mikroBUS, Adafruit Feather RP2040, PIMORONI PICO, or the PI PICO itself.
F	2023	4	String Obfuscation Software	US Citizen	t	0	4	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	Parsons develops and deploys software that represents significant investments of intellectual property and capital by our customers.  Developing and applying anti-reverse engineering techniques such as this helps prevent other parties from discovering algorithms and techniques used in the deployed software.   This is of interest to Parsons as it helps us assure the customer that their investments are protected from unnecessary loss.\n\nWe request the students design, implement, test, and deliver novel techniques to obfuscate constant strings present in compiled executables and libraries so-as to prevent (or at least hinder) their discovery during reverse engineering.   One approach we have been considering is to use a pre-compile step to remove all constant strings from the source code and place them into some sort of encrypted storage blob, replacing with some form of indexing hash that can be used to retrieve the decrypted original when needed at run-time.\n•\tFollowing the obfuscation stage, plain text constant strings must not be accessible in the binary using common system tools such as strings.exe.\n•\tAt runtime, the actual value of the strings are re-assigned to their appropriate variables as needed, but are removed from memory when no longer needed. \n•\tThe design should be portable across operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS), and platforms (ARM 64, Intel x86-64)\no\tMVP solution must compile and correctly execute on two different hardware and OS platforms approved by the customer in advance\no\tMost successful solution would support 3 or more configurations
F	2023	10	Simulation Development	Non-Resident Alien	t	2	3	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	The Interstellar Dreams Space Center is a program of the Pearl Project Institute for Innovation in S.T.E.M. Literacy, which is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.

S	2025	29	Submarine Communication Component Obsolescence Upgrade	Non-Resident Alien	\N	3	1	\N	\N	\N	Framatome has a SUSI submarine with a relatively complex control system that enables remote (tethered) control of the submarine movements as well as independent control of the on-board camera’s PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) and associated functions. Over time, various individual components within the SUSI control system have become more difficult to procure and, in many cases, completely obsolete. One such component is the U6050B transmitter and U6052B receiver integrated circuits (ICs). This single pair of components is responsible for transmitting and receiving up to 8 individual camera functions over a single conductor. Our need for this project is the following: 1) To design a single Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with modern, currently available components that will emulate the functionality of the U6050B and U6052B ICs. The overall design would include 8 individual, togglable inputs (such as switches) that would feed a configurable component (FPGA/CPLD or similar) that is programmed to emulate the U6050B transmitter IC. 2) This emulated transmitter would then “talk” to a second configurable device (FPGA/CPLD or similar) that would emulate the U6052B receiver IC. 3) Finally, the emulated receiver would drive 8 individual LEDs to simulate camera controls. The primary objective is to functually emulate the U6050B and U6052B devices such that if either device were substituted for the actual U6050B or U6052B components, both devices would function as intended.

S	2024	18	AR Object Identification	Non-Resident Alien	t	2	3	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Maintenance of cars, computers, airplanes, etc. can be easy if you are knowledgeable in the mechanics of the device. Most Computer Engineers have built or seen a computer built and can work out how to build/troubleshoot a PC if need be. However, for those who have never been exposed to the mechanics of a complex system, getting started on maintaining and troubleshooting the system can be daunting.\n\nNo matter how detailed a procedure can be, there is always room for human error in maintenance, and that error might cause the destruction of a critical system component. By developing an AR headset that assists the user in identifying objects within a mechanical system and prompting the user on how to proceed with the given steps, GDMS hopes to minimize the associated human risk factor. GDMS is interested in using the Magic Leap 2 AR headset to complete the items in this RFP.\n\nThe system must work in a standalone state, without any internet connection. Libraries must be pre-built and pre-stored. \n\nThe system of interest is a pipeline for water flow, similar to a pool’s pump system or a modern steam engine. An initial idea for layout of the system can be found in Appendix A Figure 1 below. The AR system should scan a list of QR codes, and given the data within the code, identify an object on the pipe wall that aligns with the code. The objects to be identified will be various types and colors of valves, a few of which can be seen in Appendix A Figure 2 below. Once identified, the object should be highlighted to indicate to the user that the step must be executed on that object.\n\nA stretch goal would be to implement a pop-up image of what a completed task looks like, so the user can know whether the valve is already in an off position, or whether that still needs to be done. The image pop-up might also be animated to show which wat the valve needs to be turned to properly fasten it (for the round valve types). Some examples of this can be seen in Appendix A Figure 3 of the Project Request Form.

The goal is to find an optimal ReRAM array design considering the thermal conductivities of the electrodes and filaments and the geometric density of the arrays. Here the results of the academic arrays will allow making valid extrapolations to commercial nanometer arrays.

S	2024	5	Rugged, Reusable Instrument for Measuring UV Radiation from a High-Altitude Balloon	Non-Resident Alien	t	2	3	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	For this project, we seek the development of a small, low-cost instrument capable of reliably measuring Type A (UV-A), Type B (UV-B), and Type C (UV-C) ultraviolet radiation at different heights in the atmosphere from a high-altitude scientific balloon platform to create vertical profiles from the stratosphere to the Earth’s surface. The ultimate purpose of this instrument is to support pre-college STEM programs that provide middle school students with learning opportunities in the areas of atmosphere composition, variation of UV radiation throughout the atmosphere, and how instruments are designed to meet scientific requirements. While our requirements for this instrument generally reflect a “Class D” mission (medium- to-low complexity, short lifetime, few launch constraints), we seek a rugged design that would maximize the chances for reuse on multiple balloon flights. Aside from power, which will be provided by the balloon platform, the instrument must be capable of operating autonomously using internal data storage, throughout the duration of a typical scientific balloon flight. In addition, for addressing our need for cost control, we seek a design that uses readily available commercial off-the-shelf (OTS) parts, though some custom circuits will be required, particularly for the UV-C detector and associated electronics.
S	2024	8	Asset Database and Software Bill of Materials Extraction	US Citizen	t	0	5	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	This project builds upon FoxGuard’s solution (originally created as a 2022/2023 MDE project) to build a solution installed at our customer’s premises that regularly reads Windows and Linux computer system back-ups to extract the list of installed software (plus patches) on the computer and store this information in a SQL database.\nThe project also implements the ability to copy a nominated program and the set of libraries used by the program during a back-up examination, storing them in an archive for subsequent Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) analysis. SBOMs are becoming the de facto independent method to determine the complete set of vulnerabilities that exist within an application. However, obtaining a copy of the program from a running OT system that may be many years old is operationally complicated. This project uses the back-up as a “digital twin” that allows the binary to be secured for further analysis.
S	2024	13	Use and Abuse of Personal Information	US Citizen	t	0	5	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Our personal information (PI) is used for many different purposes on the internet, and as a result, much of it is leaked and used for malicious purposes. Over the past three years, researchers at the VT National Security Institute have been investigating how PI propagates around the Internet, with the intent to conclusively link the use of PI in everyday transactions and the subsequent sharing, leakage, or otherwise misuse of that information. Thus far, an enterprise-scale collection system has been developed, consisting of a FreePBX server to track telecommunications (voice and SMS) and an Email server to receive email communications. Currently, efforts are being made to create 100,000 fake identities that accurately represent US population characteristics and research questions are being developed to target certain companies, sectors, and groups.  The purpose of this major design experiment is to kickstart the development of real-time data analytics tools that will ingest incoming data and inform both answers to core questions about PI sharing and potentially real-time intelligent reactions to received phone, SMS, and email communication content.

The Device has to have storage (like SSD) to store the data it downloads from Cimel. There is not much data, several Gb will be sufficient to store years of data\n3.       The Device has to be able to upload data to HTTPS server ( https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov).\n4.       The Device should be able to operate from battery (in past the DCP transmitters used motorcycle batteries 17 Amp-Hour (Ah) with corresponding Solar Panel).\n5.       The Device should consist primarily of commercial off-the-shelf components and those components cannot be made in China.\n6.       BE VERY ROBUST (restore after power losses, modem connection losses, etc). these instruments are often in very remote regions of the world

In parallel NASA is working to accelerate its additive manufacturing capabilities for Printed Hybrid Electronics (PHE) to enable the direct placement of electrical circuit elements onto mechanical component surfaces like door panels for a sounding rocket, X-ray detector structures, solar arrays, and mechanical limbs. Advancements in 3D printing have made it possible to rapidly manufacture parts and equipment for spacecraft and space infrastructure, helping to reduce R&D and manufacturing costs. The biggest challenge for 3D printing electronics for spaceflight applications has been converting a conventional design concept to a toolpath that a 3D printer can understand.

S	2025	2	Interactive Phased Array Beam Steering Visualization 	Non-Resident Alien	\N	3	1	\N	\N	\N	Our eyes are limited to seeing a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Creating a real-time visualization of RF beams would serve as a unique and interactive tool for understanding and demonstrating the behavior of phased array systems.  The first task is to develop a visual representation of RF beam intensity using a custom-built LED matrix powered passively by RF power detectors. Beam steering around this array will light up the LEDs closest to the proximity of the steered beam.  The second task involves integrating a controller that enables users to steer a beam with a joystick and toggle between different transmission strategies, such as fast frequency hopping.

These signals are densely packed across a broad and ever-increasing swath of frequencies. Assessing the threat environment requires identification of this wide variety of signal types accurately and quickly.\nProject: Perform a conceptual design for an analog to digital converter with an effective number of bits of at least 10, with instantaneous bandwidth of 5 GHz for use in digitizing signals modulated onto RF carriers of up to 50 GHz.
S	2025	14	Multifrequency ultrasound therapy system for advanced pressure field synthesis	Non-Resident Alien	\N	1	1	\N	\N	\N	This project is intended to support work in the Therapeutic Ultrasound Laboratory at Virginia Tech. We are developing a noninvasive focused ultrasound surgery technique called ‘histotripsy’ with the potential to treat numerous conditions and diseases. Focused ultrasound transducers used in histotripsy are currently limited in accomplishing volumetric treatments with precision due to the fixed shape of their focal beams. The goal of this project is to develop a system using multifrequency therapy that can synthesize arbitrary volumes to deliver both precise and rapid therapy for histotripsy treatments. The success of this project would have a large impact on the therapy’s ability to treat large tumors where precise margins are required, as well as those near critical structures.

S	2024	23	Manual Control Brushless DC Motor Two-Axis Control Box	Non-Resident Alien	t	3	2	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Background Information:   When performing NDE (NonDestructive Evaluation) inspections at nuclear power plants we typically have a NDE tool with BLDC (brushless DC motors with hall sensors) connected by cables to a control box. The control box is connected via LAN cable to a remote computer where an operator remotely runs the tool and performs the inspection.\n\nEngineering Need:  During the equipment set up phase of an outage it is typical for a tooling technician to have the NDE tool set up, ready to be function checked, prior to having LAN communication established to the remote computer, and prior to having a computer operator available to help with the tool functional checks. 
S	2025	7	Control and programming of analog photonic integrated circuits	US Citizen	\N	4	0	\N	\N	\N	Analog photonic integrated circuits confine laser light on a silicon chip to perform tasks ranging from computation to signal processing, which can provide significant advantages over conventional electronic and digital processing techniques. However, the extremely short wavelength of the light (1 µm) and analog nature of the chip function results in some practical limitations stemming from sources such as environmental perturbation and fabrication variances. To realize the potential of analog photonic systems, it is essential to design and implement efficient programming and control schemes that can operate without degrading performance or power efficiency. This project will explore strategies to monitor the real-time state of numerous control points and provide appropriate corrections for a photonic device. The functionality of this device will be selected in the course of the project.
S	2025	8	Personal Locator Beacon Mesh Network	Non-Resident Alien	\N	2	2	\N	\N	\N	Commercial personal locator beacons (PLBs) are used in conjunction with satellite constellations to provide third-parties access to location and status when out of range of traditional cellular infrastructure. Previous student groups have created a PLB system consisting of beacons, range extenders, and a base station. Update the existing system to act as a mesh network. Beacons should be able to receive and decode transmissions from other beacons and forward them to the base station when necessary. Standardize the hardware and software design on the beacons and range extenders so a single baseline unit is capable of operating as a transmit-only beacon, a forward-only range extender, or a full node in the mesh network. These upgrades will increase the range and reliability of the overall system, reduce the number of base stations needed to cover a given area, and reduce the cost and complexity of beacons by creating a single baseline.

S	2025	10	Cypher IP	US Citizen	\N	0	4	\N	\N	\N	Investigate and potentially prototype  an IP address assignment scheme that periodically automatically reassigns IP addresses following one time pad cyphers…\nSo the domain name server would have a separate one time pad for each IP device in the domain, and each IP device would in turn have the only other copy of its corresponding pad…. Making it very difficult to map out a network.
S	2025	11	Minimizing Bits for Communications	US Citizen	\N	0	4	\N	\N	\N	Look into whether we are minimizing bit rates for different types of tactical comms involving English language messages.  Standard alphabet characters are typically (in the conventional IT world, no idea about military comms) encoded using 8 bits = 2^8 = 256 combinations,  whereas for 26 letters and a few punctuation symbols we really only need 2^5 combinations = 5 bits.  And then if we take for instance a five letter word we could get away with 5 x 5 bits = 25 bits instead of 5 x 8 bits = 40 bits.... but 2^25 = 30M combinations whereas a typical native English speaker has a vocabulary of order 10^4  words ~ 2^13 combinations... So maybe it's possible to directly map all frequently used/known English words into 13 bit codes or thereabouts, at least if I did all that math right...

Assume the adversary uses encryption schemes on the commodity grade computing hardware available to them (e.g., consumer grade systems, not high performance or supercomputing)  How much faster do our chips need to be than theirs to break their encryption in a timely manner?  What if we can throw supercomputers at this problem?  Can we characterize how much time / compute would be required to break their encryption?  Would this encryption breaking be practical to offer as a general-purpose utility-like service to military/intel users or would it only be practical to target specific high value cases of strategic consequence?

F	2023	9	Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Navigation	US Citizen	t	2	4	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	Autonomous vehicles (e.g. self-driving cars, satellites, UAVs) rely on Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) systems to determine the vehicle’s current position/attitude and time, the next desired position/attitude and the required position, velocity and acceleration corrections needed to get to the desired state. A prior design team developed a low Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) sensor suite for a PNT sensor designed to help a vehicle navigate in through short periods where it’s primary PNT system does not have access to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals.  The focus of this design effort is to implement the sensor fusion algorithms to form a navigation solution.

The sensor fusion algorithms will be provided to the team as well as the hardware on which the software will run.  In addition to developing the software, the team will need to characterize the performance of the sensor suite that when integrated will provide the navigation solution in order to tune the sensor fusion algorithms. The design effort will culminate in characterizing the performance improvement of the fused solution over individual sensor outputs.\n\nDeliverables:\n* Fully functional navigation software that will blend outputs from multiple sensors to form a position and attitude solution.\n* Test procedure and results from characterization of each sensor’s performance in a static environment.\n* Characterization of the unit’s SWaP to ensure it meets provided requirements

Such device(s) would constantly monitor and detect abnormal noises in a wide spectrum (audible, but may also include RF, Ultrasonic, or even temperatures, etc.). The project would determine what noises are normal vs abnormal, and then alert the user via an HMI. AI would be used to learn over time what noises are normal vs abnormal based on library of normal sounds gathered at beginning of project. The system should also have the ability to input/upload new noises and then have them tagged as normal or abnormal. 
S	2025	20	High-Altitude Ballooning at Virginia Tech	Non-Resident Alien	\N	2	2	\N	\N	\N	Most amateur high-altitude ballooning flight profiles use a relatively constant ascent rate until the balloon pops and the flight string descends back to Earth. This project modifies this profile by reducing the ascent rate to a near neutral buoyancy by letting out lifting gas, or venting, from the balloon. An initial design to achieve this was implemented during the Nationwide Eclipse Ballooning Project, but was not shown to be reliable across the more than 30 engineering track teams. The mechanical structure to let the lifting gas has been developed (but is open to redesign) and is not apart of this project. However, the electronics, including a motor, a command and control system from the ground, need to be designed and tested. Being able to vent a balloon will allow for longer flight times and is a stepping stone to being able to navigate a high-altitude balloon at 80,000 ft. Design and prototype a system to enable control of venting a balloon at 80,000 ft to achieve a near-neutral buoyancy. The prototype system will be tested with a high-altitude balloon flight.

While the buck converter stage is straight-forward, the LLC is new to VPT. This project proposes the development of a constant-frequency LLC converter for use in a two-stage, radiation-hardened power converter.

S	2024	37	Battle Damage Indicator/Assessment	US Citizen	t	2	3	Completed	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	Determining effectiveness of High Power Microwave (HPM) Systems, which are used against unmanned aerial system (UAS) targets, is key to HPM development. This is a challenge due to the EM environment that any UAS based sensor would be placed in. However, it is possible to remotely detect sound or unintended RF emissions from the UAS to determine any effects on the UAS. We would like the team to design an apparatus using a parabolic microphone and signal processing to determine effects on UAS. Additionally, the team should identify other characteristics that can be determined such as target type, distance, and pose.\n\nProject Description\nThe team will create an apparatus that is able to detect prop noise from a class 1 UAS. A computer should be used to capture the data and do analysis to determine prop RPMs and identify significant changes in RPM. The device should be able to detect UAS prop noise from a minimum of 10 ft with a stretch goal of 100+ ft which may be achieved using a parabolic microphone. \n\nThe team should also develop data processing software to capture the RPM data and perform analysis. The analysis should be able to determine RPM of a single prop or aggregate of the system and determine changes in the RPM. Additional goals for analysis would be to determine RPMs for multiple props, identify multiple UASs at a time, determine type of UAS, estimate distance and elevation of UAS from measurement device, and determine UAS pose in relation to measurement device. NSWCDD will provide information to include waveforms, measurement capturing equipment, and UAS targets.\n\nThe final output of this project will be a team visit to NSWCDD to demonstrate the system in operation during an HPM test event. Additionally, the team will provide the sound capture apparatus, source code, documentation for use and limitations, and documentation for expanding the model to future UAS targets.
F	2023	12	Swing Stabilization for MEDEVAC Rescues	Non-Resident Alien	t	0	5	Completed	2023-10-11 17:23:56.154329+00	\N	There is a need for a mechanical stabilization system for low-mass sling loads in medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) rescues. Such a system has potential for integration for use by Black Hawk helicopters in the U.S. Army. Breeze-Eastern LLC manufactures the hoists on Black Hawk helicopters used in the U.S. Army. Collaborators also include an expert in nonlinear dynamics who is a faculty member at Sapienza University in Rome, Italy as well as a faculty in Blacksburg, VA. An officer in the U.S. Army expressed interest in the possibility of the team participating in a “Marne Innovations Challenge.” The main objective of this research is to characterize the existing device, simulate the variables, and characterize a 30-foot cable with scaled weights in the Virginia Tech Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology (ICAT). \n\nParticipating students will design, test, and characterize stabilization control models of suspended loads, simulating live rescue scenarios from helicopter platforms.  Building from work from previous cadets, students, and industry professionals, participants in this program will model rescue hoist scenarios, develop creative approaches, perform engineering trade-off analyses, and account for realistic variables and constraints (see section 3.0) in the design and executed simulations.  Students will document their work and processes to sponsors and peers.  A primary goal will be to engineer a proof-of-concept demonstration in order to justify next-step testing on combat helicopter platforms. \n\nStudents may also have the opportunity to participate in a “Marne Innovations Challenge” organized through the U.S. Army contact LT Thomas Aldhizer at Ft. Stewart, GA.

6	Drone Instrument to Advance Search for Life in Our Solar System	Non-Resident Alien	t	3	2	For this project, we seek the miniaturization and improvement of instrument electronics to operate a revolutionary multifunctional sensor platform technology developed by researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).  The multifunctional sensor platform can provide autonomous, in-situ detection of methane and other trace gases that are important in the search for life throughout the solar system. The current implementation of the instrument electronics is about the size of large camera, can be mounted on a tripod, and has low power requirements.  Part of the path to advancing this technology towards applications in space involves field demonstrations here on Earth, in Alaska.  For these field demonstrations, the GSFC team seeks concepts that would further miniaturize the instrument electronics to make them more compact and suitable for deployment as a drone payload (under 2 kg).  The researchers are planning a follow-up field campaign in the summer of 2024. For this they would like to augment the measurements from their stationary sensor platforms with mobile and autonomous drone-based sensor systems.  Eventually researchers would like to deploy these sensors to the Moon, Mars, and Ocean Worlds, across a variety of spacecraft, rovers, and drones to continue the search for life in our solar system.  	\N	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	\N	S	2024	MDE	\N
7	Decision Tree Graphical Editor and Execution for Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities	US Citizen	t	0	5	Decision trees are customer-specific; the expectation is that customers will start with a standard tree (such as CISA’s SSVC) and then adapt it to better fit their specific decision policy to better match their cybersecurity program. Essentially the decision tree encodes their cybersecurity playbook for how to handle a vulnerability for each machine within their OT system.\nThis project creates a graphical editor to create a new or modify an existing decision tree. The decision tree’s structure, consisting of inputs, decision points (aka nodes), and possible outcomes, are stored in a database. The editor supports the ability to interactively “run” the decision tree configuration against different test scenarios, as well as to autonomously execute all test cases as a regression test	\N	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	\N	S	2024	MDE	\N
8	Asset Database and Software Bill of Materials Extraction	US Citizen	t	0	5	This project builds upon FoxGuard’s solution (originally created as a 2022/2023 MDE project) to build a solution installed at our customer’s premises that regularly reads Windows and Linux computer system back-ups to extract the list of installed software (plus patches) on the computer and store this information in a SQL database.\nThe project also implements the ability to copy a nominated program and the set of libraries used by the program during a back-up examination, storing them in an archive for subsequent Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) analysis. SBOMs are becoming the de facto independent method to determine the complete set of vulnerabilities that exist within an application. However, obtaining a copy of the program from a running OT system that may be many years old is operationally complicated. This project uses the back-up as a “digital twin” that allows the binary to be secured for further analysis.	\N	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	\N	S	2024	MDE	\N

12	Design of a Solution to Increase Capacity and Cooling in an Existing Data Center	Non-Resident Alien	t	3	2	Data Centers are vital in today’s “connected” world and they store, process, and disseminate data continuously to support everything from financial transactions to social media. Because of increasing demand, these data centers continue to pop up in record numbers across the landscape, particularly in Northern Virginia, due to the abundance of fiber connectivity and low-cost utility power.  With the recent proliferation of AI (artificial intelligence) and future computing demands that come with it, computer servers and other rack-based equipment will need to utilize more power and cooling than ever and are hitting constraints at the individual rack/cabinet level.  The goal of this project would be to design a “rack of the future” that would be able to handle AI computing workloads. 	\N	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	\N	S	2024	MDE	\N
13	Use and Abuse of Personal Information	US Citizen	t	0	5	Our personal information (PI) is used for many different purposes on the internet, and as a result, much of it is leaked and used for malicious purposes. Over the past three years, researchers at the VT National Security Institute have been investigating how PI propagates around the Internet, with the intent to conclusively link the use of PI in everyday transactions and the subsequent sharing, leakage, or otherwise misuse of that information. Thus far, an enterprise-scale collection system has been developed, consisting of a FreePBX server to track telecommunications (voice and SMS) and an Email server to receive email communications. Currently, efforts are being made to create 100,000 fake identities that accurately represent US population characteristics and research questions are being developed to target certain companies, sectors, and groups.  The purpose of this major design experiment is to kickstart the development of real-time data analytics tools that will ingest incoming data and inform both answers to core questions about PI sharing and potentially real-time intelligent reactions to received phone, SMS, and email communication content.  	\N	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	\N	S	2024	MDE	\N

18	AR Object Identification	Non-Resident Alien	t	2	3	Maintenance of cars, computers, airplanes, etc. can be easy if you are knowledgeable in the mechanics of the device. Most Computer Engineers have built or seen a computer built and can work out how to build/troubleshoot a PC if need be. However, for those who have never been exposed to the mechanics of a complex system, getting started on maintaining and troubleshooting the system can be daunting.\n\nNo matter how detailed a procedure can be, there is always room for human error in maintenance, and that error might cause the destruction of a critical system component. By developing an AR headset that assists the user in identifying objects within a mechanical system and prompting the user on how to proceed with the given steps, GDMS hopes to minimize the associated human risk factor. GDMS is interested in using the Magic Leap 2 AR headset to complete the items in this RFP.\n\nThe system must work in a standalone state, without any internet connection. Libraries must be pre-built and pre-stored. \n\nThe system of interest is a pipeline for water flow, similar to a pool’s pump system or a modern steam engine. An initial idea for layout of the system can be found in Appendix A Figure 1 below. The AR system should scan a list of QR codes, and given the data within the code, identify an object on the pipe wall that aligns with the code. The objects to be identified will be various types and colors of valves, a few of which can be seen in Appendix A Figure 2 below. Once identified, the object should be highlighted to indicate to the user that the step must be executed on that object.\n\nA stretch goal would be to implement a pop-up image of what a completed task looks like, so the user can know whether the valve is already in an off position, or whether that still needs to be done. The image pop-up might also be animated to show which wat the valve needs to be turned to properly fasten it (for the round valve types). Some examples of this can be seen in Appendix A Figure 3 of the Project Request Form.	\N	2023-09-11 16:55:56.429632+00	\N	\N	S	2024	MDE	\N

We would like the team to design an apparatus using a parabolic microphone and signal processing to determine effects on UAS. Additionally, the team should identify other characteristics that can be determined such as target type, distance, and pose.\n\nProject Description\nThe team will create an apparatus that is able to detect prop noise from a class 1 UAS. A computer should be used to capture the data and do analysis to determine prop RPMs and identify significant changes in RPM. The device should be able to detect UAS prop noise from a minimum of 10 ft with a stretch goal of 100+ ft which may be achieved using a parabolic microphone. \n\nThe team should also develop data processing software to capture the RPM data and perform analysis. The analysis should be able to determine RPM of a single prop or aggregate of the system and determine changes in the RPM. Additional goals for analysis would be to determine RPMs for multiple props, identify multiple UASs at a time, determine type of UAS, estimate distance and elevation of UAS from measurement device, and determine UAS pose in relation to measurement device. NSWCDD will provide information to include waveforms, measurement capturing equipment, and UAS targets.\n\nThe final output of this project will be a team visit to NSWCDD to demonstrate the system in operation during an HPM test event.

159	Cypher IP	US Citizen	\N	0	4	Investigate and potentially prototype  an IP address assignment scheme that periodically automatically reassigns IP addresses following one time pad cyphers…\nSo the domain name server would have a separate one time pad for each IP device in the domain, and each IP device would in turn have the only other copy of its corresponding pad…. Making it very difficult to map out a network.	\N	\N	\N	DOT&E - 1	S	2025	MDE	10
160	Minimizing Bits for Communications	US Citizen	\N	0	4	Look into whether we are minimizing bit rates for different types of tactical comms involving English language messages.  Standard alphabet characters are typically (in the conventional IT world, no idea about military comms) encoded using 8 bits = 2^8 = 256 combinations,  whereas for 26 letters and a few punctuation symbols we really only need 2^5 combinations = 5 bits.  And then if we take for instance a five letter word we could get away with 5 x 5 bits = 25 bits instead of 5 x 8 bits = 40 bits.... but 2^25 = 30M combinations whereas a typical native English speaker has a vocabulary of order 10^4  words ~ 2^13 combinations... So maybe it's possible to directly map all frequently used/known English words into 13 bit codes or thereabouts, at least if I did all that math right...	\N	\N	\N	DOT&E - 2	S	2025	MDE	11
161	Asymmetric Decryption Overmatch	US Citizen	\N	0	4	Considering recent chip embargos, investigate how much compute is required to break adversaries' potential encryption schemes.  Assume the adversary uses encryption schemes on the commodity grade computing hardware available to them (e.g., consumer grade systems, not high performance or supercomputing)  How much faster do our chips need to be than theirs to break their encryption in a timely manner?  What if we can throw supercomputers at this problem?  Can we characterize how much time / compute would be required to break their encryption?  Would this encryption breaking be practical to offer as a general-purpose utility-like service to military/intel users or would it only be practical to target specific high value cases of strategic consequence?	\N	\N	\N	DOT&E - 3	S	2025	MDE	12
163	Multifrequency ultrasound therapy system for advanced pressure field synthesis	Non-Resident Alien	\N	1	1	This project is intended to support work in the Therapeutic Ultrasound Laboratory at Virginia Tech. We are developing a noninvasive focused ultrasound surgery technique called ‘histotripsy’ with the potential to treat numerous conditions and diseases. Focused ultrasound transducers used in histotripsy are currently limited in accomplishing volumetric treatments with precision due to the fixed shape of their focal beams. The goal of this project is to develop a system using multifrequency therapy that can synthesize arbitrary volumes to deliver both precise and rapid therapy for histotripsy treatments. The success of this project would have a large impact on the therapy’s ability to treat large tumors where precise margins are required, as well as those near critical structures. 	\N	\N	\N	Virginia Tech	S	2025	MDE	14

The prototype mechanical design of the system exists, as do preliminary designs of some electronic subsystems, but none of the latter have been fully tested or integrated into a complete system.  The overall goal of the project is to design, build, integrate, and test the printed circuit boards necessary to enable further laboratory-based testing and validation of the complete instrument concept. 	\N	\N	\N	Virginia Tech	S	2025	MDE	15

168	Data Center Electrical Room Prognostic Noise Sampling device 	Non-Resident Alien	\N	4	0	Data Centers are vital in today’s connected world and they store, process, and disseminate data continuously to support everything from financial transactions to social media. The infrastructure within these data centers is critical and regular maintenance on the equipment as well as quick reaction and response to abnormal events is required to provide 100% uptime for the equipment and the end users. This project would create a prognostic noise sampling device or series of devices, to be deployed in an electrical room that houses UPS systems, Switchgear, breakers, and cooling systems. Such device(s) would constantly monitor and detect abnormal noises in a wide spectrum (audible, but may also include RF, Ultrasonic, or even temperatures, etc.). The project would determine what noises are normal vs abnormal, and then alert the user via an HMI. AI would be used to learn over time what noises are normal vs abnormal based on library of normal sounds gathered at beginning of project. The system should also have the ability to input/upload new noises and then have them tagged as normal or abnormal. 	\N	\N	\N	7 x 24 Exchange	S	2025	MDE	19
169	High-Altitude Ballooning at Virginia Tech	Non-Resident Alien	\N	2	2	Most amateur high-altitude ballooning flight profiles use a relatively constant ascent rate until the balloon pops and the flight string descends back to Earth. This project modifies this profile by reducing the ascent rate to a near neutral buoyancy by letting out lifting gas, or venting, from the balloon. An initial design to achieve this was implemented during the Nationwide Eclipse Ballooning Project, but was not shown to be reliable across the more than 30 engineering track teams. The mechanical structure to let the lifting gas has been developed (but is open to redesign) and is not apart of this project. However, the electronics, including a motor, a command and control system from the ground, need to be designed and tested. Being able to vent a balloon will allow for longer flight times and is a stepping stone to being able to navigate a high-altitude balloon at 80,000 ft. Design and prototype a system to enable control of venting a balloon at 80,000 ft to achieve a near-neutral buoyancy. The prototype system will be tested with a high-altitude balloon flight.	\N	\N	\N	Virginia Tech	S	2025	MDE	20
170	LoRaWAN Deployment and Demonstration	Non-Resident Alien	\N	2	2	LoRa is a proprietary wireless communications technology designed to provide long-range (multiple kilometers) connectivity for very low data rate (10’s of kilobits per second) for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. LoRa operates in the license-free US915 frequency band in the United States. LoRaWAN1 is an ITU standard that builds on LoRa technology to define open standards for medium access control, LoRaWAN Gateway, and LoRaWAN Network Server functions to enable network connectivity and end-to-end application data transfer and management. In this project, the student team will deploy a functioning LoRaWAN network, characterize coverage and data rates for the deployment, and demonstrate a basic sensor node application using the network.	\N	\N	\N	Virginia Tech	S	2025	MDE	21

Solar energy is the primary method for powering most spacecraft and small commercial electronics can be leveraged for some small satellite applications, with proper considerations for radiation and thermal effects.	\N	\N	\N	Northrop Grumman	S	2025	MDE	22
172	Radiation-Hardened LLC Converter	Non-Resident Alien	\N	4	0	VPT makes power conversion products for high-reliability applications and would like to explore a two-stage power conversion solution such as a buck-fed LLC converter. The buck converter would provide output voltage regulation, and the LLC converter would operate as an isolated constant gain stage. This solution would allow constant frequency operation, and it would greatly reduce the complexity and cost of the LLC control. While the buck converter stage is straight-forward, the LLC is new to VPT. This project proposes the development of a constant-frequency LLC converter for use in a two-stage, radiation-hardened power converter.	\N	\N	\N	VPT	S	2025	MDE	23

The successful project shall also demonstrate use of the interface by automating and demonstrating one or more measurements that use the interface that you develop and/or extend, to control the tinySA Ultra.  The demonstrations should also include automation of the corresponding data analysis and visualization. Second, the project should develop and demonstrate a web-based interface, e.g., using Plotly Dash, that lets students write and run scripts to remotely control observations or measurements made by the tinySA, using the interface that you develop and/or extend.  The interface should demonstrate ability to write control scripts for the tinySA Ultra using both SCPI commands and Python.	\N	\N	\N	Virginia Tech	S	2025	MDE	24
174	SuperDARN HF Radar Lab	Non-Resident Alien	\N	4	0	Design and prototype a system to remotely monitor parameters (voltages/status and temperature) on a SuperDARN transmitter.  The prototype system will be tested in a transmitter setup in a lab at Virginia Tech. The SuperDARN HF Radar Lab at Virginia Tech operates 5 radars at 4 sites between Virginia, Kansas, northern Ontario, and Labrador.  Each of these sites uses an electrically steerable array to scan across a field-of-view.  To receive enough signal off of plasma irregularities in the ionosphere, each site uses 16 transmitters.  Each transmitter is capable of putting RF power forward, but switches fast enough to pass low-power received signals onto to be phased corrected.  The transmitters currently have some simple controls to protect itself from doing unnecessary damage to some circuits.  However, the ability to remotely monitor the status of each of the transmitters any of the sites does not exist.  Knowing the condition of each of the transmitters remotely helps researchers prepare for costly maintenance trips that may happen only once or twice a year.	\N	\N	\N	Virginia Tech	S	2025	MDE	25

This SCADA system will serve as a common interface for independent control systems, offering full visibility, data logging, and manipulation capabilities across all sites. The project will involve the development of system architecture, networking, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for data visibility and control. Students will be responsible for developing a SCADA system to support one launch pad. The project will involve building a graphical user interface (UI), mapping the UI to specific inputs and outputs (I/O), developing SCADA architecture, and ensuring reliable communication between the SCADA system and the launch pad using Ethernet/IP. By the end of the project, the launch pad should be fully operational with SCADA support.	\N	\N	Norfolk, VA	Virginia Spaceport Authority	S	2025	MDE	28
178	Submarine Communication Component Obsolescence Upgrade	Non-Resident Alien	\N	3	1	Framatome has a SUSI submarine with a relatively complex control system that enables remote (tethered) control of the submarine movements as well as independent control of the on-board camera’s PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) and associated functions. Over time, various individual components within the SUSI control system have become more difficult to procure and, in many cases, completely obsolete. One such component is the U6050B transmitter and U6052B receiver integrated circuits (ICs). This single pair of components is responsible for transmitting and receiving up to 8 individual camera functions over a single conductor. Our need for this project is the following: 1) To design a single Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with modern, currently available components that will emulate the functionality of the U6050B and U6052B ICs. The overall design would include 8 individual, togglable inputs (such as switches) that would feed a configurable component (FPGA/CPLD or similar) that is programmed to emulate the U6050B transmitter IC. 2) This emulated transmitter would then “talk” to a second configurable device (FPGA/CPLD or similar) that would emulate the U6052B receiver IC. 3) Finally, the emulated receiver would drive 8 individual LEDs to simulate camera controls. The primary objective is to functually emulate the U6050B and U6052B devices such that if either device were substituted for the actual U6050B or U6052B components, both devices would function as intended.	\N	\N	\N	Framatome	S	2025	MDE	29

180	Implementation of code to perform HF ray tracing in the ionosphere and explore its applications	Non-Resident Alien	\N	3	1	High-frequency (HF) radiowave systems find wide application in communications, surveillance, and space science. The particular advantage of operating on HF is the possibility of over the horizon (OTH) performance by utilizing the refractive properties of the ionosphere in this frequency range.  There are technical challenges in understanding how the signal propagates that can be addressed with first-principles propagation modeling that draws on a model of the ionosphere.  The goals of the project are to understand the basics of HF radiowave propagation and its value for civilian and military systems; to implement a Matlab-based toolbox of code that performs ray tracing in the ionosphere using a prescribed ionospheric model; and to use the code to demonstrate the viability of the HF technique in a series of practical applications. Students should have taken the EM core courses, ECE 3105 and 3106.  Additional courses in communications, radiowave propagation, antennas, etc., would be helpful.  Students should have good MATLAB programming skills.	\N	\N	\N	Virginia Tech	S	2025	MDE	31
181	Communication and Control Equipment and Processes to Improve Remote Operation of Aquaculture Equipment	Non-Resident Alien	\N	2	2	This project will provide an evaluation of communication and control equipment and processes to improve and enhance the remote operation of aquaculture equipment. Remote operations are necessary for aquaculture operations in areas not readily accessible for traditional methods employing crews for maintenance and harvesting. Weather, shallow waters, lack of access to commercial facilities are all reasons that remote operation using robotic equipment can greatly reduce manpower costs and improve the quality of growing conditions.
